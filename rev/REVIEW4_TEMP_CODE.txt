Findings:
1.[Improve presentation] Add description of general content for files temperature.c and temperature.h
2.[Improve presentation] Add relevant comments for read_button_status and temp_conversion functions from temperature.h file (lines 22, 23)
3.[Improve presentation] Specify the correspondent pins for button_1 and button_2 variables in file temperature.c (lines 20, 21)
4.[Improve presentation] Specify the methods of conversion implemented in function temp_conversion  in temperature.c (lines 72-81)
5.[Functional improvement] Implement initial functionality for temperature display
6.[Functional improvement] Eliminate t variable from temp_conversion and call temp_read() in conversion implementation
7.[Functional improvement] Use a bool variable to change conversion type or a switch
8.[Functional improvement] Remove the test code from module implementation in temperature.c (lines 91 -117)
9.[Functional improvement] Eliminate delay from function temp_conversion in temperature.c (line 85) and timer32 header from temperature.h (line 20)
10.[Functional improvement] Prior to integration, remove initialization calls and includes from the modules that communicate with the TEMP module
11.[Functional improvement] Create different source and header files for PUSH_BUTTON module 

Types of findings:
[Functional improvement] = Used in case the code doesn't work without the modification or if the functionality is affected by the finding
[Improve presentation] = Used in case aditional information must be used. The code works as it is, but it's harder to understand
[Open point] = Used for questions unaswered during the review process
