Findings:
1. [Improve presentation] - Change "Description: push_button.c header file" to "Description: push button module header file" in file push_button.h line 4 (implemented in 3921312)
2. [Improve presentation] - Correct description of the file push_button.c to "Description: push button module implementation file" (line 4)   (implemented in 3921312)
3. [Functional improvement] - Encapsulate all the commented lines between /*....*/ (each line) in all files   (implemented in 3921312)
4. [Functional improvement] - In push_button.h, add a #define ADC_CHANNEL 5 /*ADC Channel that will be used. Change the configuration here if needed*/   (implemented in 3921312)
5. [Functional improvement] - Replace the if instruction from push_button.c file (line 26) with a switch statement and use as switch argument the ADCRead(ADC_CHANNEL) defined at the previous finding (implemented in 3921312)
6. [Functional improvement] - Add a bool variable for function read_button_status() and use it to collect the button status. At the end of the function return this bool variable.  (implemented in 3921312)

QA check: OK. Review closed

Types of findings:
[Functional improvement] = Used in case the code doesn't work without the modification or if the functionality is affected by the finding
[Improve presentation] = Used in case aditional information must be used. The code works as it is, but it's harder to understand
[Open point] = Used for questions unaswered during the review process
